<h1 style="text-align:center;">Help in Online Shopping</h1>
<h3>Are you tired of driving to the mall and fighting the crowds just to get the things you want and need? Online shopping has become a massive industry, and is more secure than ever. You can find virtually any product online, as long as you know where to look. You can also find some of the best deals. See Step 1 below to learn how to find what you want and buy it with confidence and security.</h3>
<h1>Finding the Perfect Product</h1>
<h3>One of the most effective ways to quickly find sites that are selling the product you want is to simply search for the product using a search engine like Google, Yahoo!, or Bing. If the product is popular, you will receive several pages of links to shops that offer it. You can use this as a starting point for comparing prices.</h3>
<h1>Look for your product on online store.</h1><h3> Beyond selling products themselves, online store acts as a liaison between you and a massive number of third-party vendors. The companies and people all use online store as a way to list products and use the online payment system. This means online store and its third-party vendors has one of the largest inventories available on the planet</h3>
<h3>Online store allows for vendors to sell used goods, so be aware of the product you are buying if you need it new.</h3>
<h1>Check auction sites. </h1><h3>For harder to find items, check online auction sites. These are a little more hands-on than simply purchasing from a store, but you can potentially find good deals and rare items if you take the time. See this guide for tips on auction sites.
Auction sites have a lot more rules and regulations than traditional stores, and require a fair amount of input from you, the buyer. Make sure that you are familiar with all of the rules and regulations before you begin bidding.</h3>
<h1>Visit market-specific sites.</h1><h3> Beyond the big-name stores and auction sites, there are also a variety of marketplaces that cater to specific markets. You may be able to find better deals for what you need, or bulk options that weren't available in the big stores.
<h1>Don't forget to check the product manufacturer's site as well.</h1><h3> You may be able to save some money buying direct from the manufacturer instead of through a retailer. Not all manufacturers have their own online stores.
There are a variety of sites that will collect prices from a wide selection of online stores and return a comparison.</h3>

<h1>Trust your gut.</h1><h3> If you start to feel pressured into a purchase or you feel that the deal may be too good to be true, trust your instincts and avoid the sale. There are plenty of people who offer get-rich-quick schemes and "life-changing" products, but these should all be met with a hefty dose of skepticism.</h3>
<h1>Note the shipping costs.</h1><h3>Even if you find an amazing deal on an item, it might be offset by what you have to pay to ship it. If the shipping costs are outrageous, ask yourself if it's worth paying to ship as opposed to getting it from the store downtown.
Compare the costs of different shipping methods. If you don't need it immediately, you could save yourself a lot of money by picking a slower shipping method.
Be especially wary of shipping costs from auction sites. These are set at the discretion of the seller, and unscrupulous senders may hike up shipping to take advantage of customers.</h3>
<h1>Avoid refurbished items if possible.</h1><h3>Refurbished items are often sold for close to the amount of a new one, but have been repaired to be resold. While you may be able to find good deals this way, avoid it if possible. If you are going to be buying refurbished, check the warranty and ensure that the coverage is good in case it fails again.</h3>
<h1>Use a credit card instead of a debit card.</h1><h3> You will have much more security if your account is compromised if you pay with a credit card instead of a debit card. This is because if your debit card information is stolen, the thieves have direct access to your bank account, whereas if the credit card information is stolen, it can all be quickly reversed by the credit card company.
Try to use one credit card for all online purchases to help minimize the risk and keep any potential incidents isolated.</h3>
<h3>
Never make a purchase on an unsecured wireless network. If you are connected to an unsecured wireless network, any data that you send out from your device is unencrypted until it reaches the router. This means that hackers can "listen in" on your device and the information you are sending and receiving from the internet.</h3>
<h3>Archive your receipts. Keep a record of all of your purchases so that you can compare your receipts to your bank statement. It will also help to have receipts for legitimate purchases in the event of fraud.</h3>
